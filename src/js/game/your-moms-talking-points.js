    "Hey there, I just wanted to check in with you...",
    "There you are! I've been trying to call you all day!",
    "Well the neighbors got new dogs and they just bark all the time!",
    "Do you remember Bettie Klein? She passed away last week.",
    "We need to talk."
  ],
  "request": [
    "I hope your new little thing is working out ok.",
    "I'd like you to think about getting a job doing something else. Anything else.",
    "I'd like you to call more often. I really don't know how you are doing or if you are addicted to drugs!",
    "I haven't seen you on TV but Tammy MacElroy swears she saw you in a commercial for some personal injury lawyer.",
    "I went to church last week and they brought in a group who was working with puppets for the kids. Maybe this is something you would like to look into?"
  ],
  "emphasis": [
    "I just really think you should rethink this whole acting thing.",
    "I just don't know what to tell people when they ask what you are doing!",
    "Is this really what you thought you would do with a marketing degree?",
    "...Are you still there?",
    "Annie Wilkins, who was a year or two younger than you just graduated from med school. Her mother is so proud."
  ],
  "conclusion": [
    "Well, I hope you have something better to tell me the next time we talk.",
    "Be careful, I heard that gangs are drugging people at parties so they can steal their organs.",
    "Well, just think it over. I think you will make the right decision.",
    "Goodbye. I love you.",
    "Well, anyway, I just wanted to check in. I saw there's supposed to be cold snap next week so please don't forget your hat."
